# PSAT-SAT-Test-Answer-Simulation
Should you use the Letter-of-the-Day or pick random letters on questions you are unsure of on the PSAT/SAT?

 * This program attempts to compare scores on a 131 question test that is meant
 * to simulate the Reading, Writing, and Math multiple choice sections of the PSAT. The first option is to pick a letter
 * of the day and choose that for all questions. Otherwise, you can guess a random letter.
 * (This assumes you don't know the answer to any of the questions, which I hope is not the case)
 
 
 * Keep in mind that this program has many limitations.
 * For example, the SAT answer distribution is not necessarily uniform.
 * In addition, even if it were, Math.random() would fail to replicate those 
 * conditions due to its pseudorandom nature.
 
# Results
Most of the time, picking a Letter-of-the-Day for all unsure questions will earn you more points than picking random letters for those same questions.
